### Device Grading Rubric
| Device Score-Category | Device |  Rating | Description of Ratings | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Requires Constant Internet Connection | x | Yes / No / Hybrid | x |
| Requires Constant Connection to Company Cloud Infrastructure | x | Yes / No / Hybrid | x |
| Data Storage Risk Score | x | Cloud / Local / Hybrid | x |
| Data Gathering Risk Score | x | 1 - 5 | 5. Minimal Data collection: The device only collects essential data for core functionality, no PII, third-party sharing or external data transmission.<br><br> 4. Limited Data collection: The device collects minimal PII (e.g., name, email) for essential functions, encrypts data, and provides clear opt-out options for non-essential tracking.<br><br> 3. Moderate Data Collection: The device collects more data than necessary, shares some with third parties for analytics, and offers opt-out options that may be difficult to find or use.<br><br> 2. Extensive Data Collection: The device collects significant PII (e.g., location, voice recordings), shares it with multiple third parties, and provides limited or unclear opt-out options.<br><br> 1. Extreme Data Collection: The device collects excessive sensitive data (e.g., always-on listening, continuous tracking), shares it widely without consent, and offers no way to disable tracking or delete data. |
| Company Vulnerability Remediation Score | x | 1 - 5 | 5. Excellent Remediation: The company rapidly patches vulnerabilities, provides regular updates, and proactively communicates fixes to users.<br><br> 4. Good Remediation: The company addresses most vulnerabilities promptly but may delay minor fixes or lack proactive communication.<br><br> 3. Moderation Remediation: The company fixes major vulnerabilities within reasonable timeframes but often neglects minor issues and provides limited updates to users.<br><br> 2. Poor Remediation: The company delays fixing vulnerabilities significantly, rarely updates devices, and provides minimal or unclear communication about security issues.<br><br> 1. Negligent Remediation: The company rarely or never patches vulnerabilities, leaves devices exposed to known risks, and fails to inform users about security threats. |
