## Technical Plan

- Logan
  - Week 1-2 - Identify IoT Device Categories
  - Week 2-3 - Gather Case Studies on IoT Vulnerabilities
- Tyler
  - Week 3-4 - Analyze IoT Security Weaknesses
  - Week 4-5 - Evaluate Manufacturer Security Practices
- Josh
  - Week 5-6 - Investigate Consumer IoT Management Challenges
  - Week 6-7 - Develop Best Practices for Consumers
- Lucas
  - Week 7-8: Review and Refine Security Guidelines
Objective: Ensure that the security guidelines are comprehensive, well-structured, provide clear and actionable insights. This would also include a sign-off from each group member to ensure that everyone has properly reviewed the guidelines. 
  Sub-Tasks:
  1.	Request Feedback
      - Share the draft with peers or mentors for feedback.
      - Focus on coverage, depth, and grading rubric for completeness. This will help ensure all necessary requirements are addressed. 
  2.	Validate Security Risks & Best Practices
      - Compare the proposed guidelines against current security reports and standards CISA, OWASP, or NIST guidelines. This could involve IoT specific ratings such as UL IoT Security Rating, ioXt Alliance, or CTIA Cybersecurity Certification for IoT. 
      - Verify that high-risk categories that were determined and written about include specific mitigation steps or reference best practices.
      - Ensure the guide provides manufacturer security evaluation criteria if available.
  3.	Refine Actionable Recommendations
      - Enhance best practices based on user feedback.
      - Ensure each section includes clear step-by-step actions or instructions if necessary, this could also cite manufacturers instructions. 
      - Include examples or case studies where possible to improve user understanding.
  4.	Improve Readability and Structure
      - Ensure the language is consumer-friendly while still being technically accurate.
      - Add table of contents, bullet points, or checklists to improve accessibility.
      - Include a short FAQ section addressing common IoT security concerns.

  - Week 8-10: Finalize Documentation & Publish on GitHub
Objective: Prepare a well-documented, structured, and publicly accessible guide that is accessibility-friendly and includes graphs, charts, or plots where applicable.
  Sub-Tasks
  1. Format the Documentation for GitHub
      - Convert the guide into Markdown format for compatibility.
      - Write a structured README explaining the purpose, usage, and key features of the guide.
      - Structure sections using README.md and additional sub-files for organization.
      - Add a table of contents for easy navigation.
  3. Perform Final Proofreading & Technical Verification
      - Use proofreading tools to check for readability, clarity, and grammar issues.
      - Verify all technical instructions, commands, and update procedures.
      - Have a peer or mentor test the guide to ensure any technical instructions are clear and easy to follow.
  4. Publish the Guide on GitHub
      - Update the GitHub repository and upload all supporting documentation.
      - Share the repository link with relevant cybersecurity communities, forums, and assignment for grading.
