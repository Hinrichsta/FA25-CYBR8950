## Literature Review

### Home Automation - Josh
 - No particular term, but included since we talked about it as a group.  UL traditionally was a certifiation for anything electrical, certify phyiscal safety, looks liek they are getting into Cyber with IoT devices, which are indeed all electric.
    - [UL Solutions named Lead Administrator in the first-ever U.S. Federal Cybersecurity Labeling Program](https://www.ul.com/services/ul-verified-iot-device-security-rating)
- Smart Home Privacy - (general)
    - [A risk analysis of a smart home automation system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167739X15002812)
- Smart home speakers (from a control system perspective vs. entertainment)
    - [Alexa, Are You Listening?: Privacy Perceptions, Concerns and Privacy-seeking Behaviors with Smart Speakers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3274371)
- Smart Thermostats (of which most are also Alex and/or Google speakers) - also general
   - [Security and Privacy Issues with Smart Thermostats – A First Look](https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1036560/)
- Smart Home Security Systems (AKA, DO it yourself vs. the tradditional ADT, etc..)
   - [Emerging Trends in Smart Home Security,
Privacy, and Digital Forensics ](https://web.archive.org/web/20200323123821id_/https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1434&context=amcis2016)
- Smart Smoke Alarms - This is interesting as it discuss the concerns of using the cloud vs. local to analyze video to detect a fire.

  - [Smart IoT Devices in the Home: Security and Privacy Implications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8371556)
 
  - #### Added by Josh, I ran across this doing SmartHome stuff, but thought it was interesting as it adds the human perspective from Nannies.  Also for disccsion, should be add drones, to the camera category, since most consumer drones mainly are cameras...today.
