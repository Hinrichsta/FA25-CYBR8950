## Problem Statement
The growing reliance on internet-connected devices has created significant security and privacy concerns for consumers. Many Internet of Things (IoT) devices designed for home use such as smart cameras, doorbells, speakers, and appliances are inherently insecure due to poor security measures at launch or become vulnerable over time due to a lack of updates and user management. Consumers often purchase these devices without fully understanding the risks associated with always-online connectivity, leaving them exposed to data breaches, unauthorized surveillance, and cyberattacks.

## Project Goals
- Identify categories of IoT devices that pose security risks in home environments due to weak security protocols, poor update policies, or lack of user awareness.
- Analyze common vulnerabilities, such as default credentials, unencrypted data transmissions, and delayed or absent security patches.
- Evaluate manufacturer responsibility in maintaining device security and the challenges consumers face in managing these risks.
- Provide best practices for consumers to mitigate security threats, including secure configurations, firmware updates, and network segmentation.

## Project Merit
This project highlights the urgent need for consumer awareness regarding IoT security, emphasizing the risks of poorly managed smart home devices. By examining real-world vulnerabilities and proposing actionable security measures, this work benefits not only individual consumers but also industry stakeholders looking to improve IoT security standards. Increased awareness and proactive management can help mitigate data privacy concerns, prevent device exploitation, and create a safer digital ecosystem for smart home users.
