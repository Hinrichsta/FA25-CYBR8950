During our Milestone 1 meeting, our team worked collaboratively on the project's groundwork by addressing several key tasks. We worked on the GitHub repository as a group by creating the necessary files and setting up a Kanban task board to organize our workflow. Worked together on drafting a preliminary project timeline proposal and conducting a risk analysis to identify and rank potential challenges. We agreed to reconvene on Monday to follow up on these items and ensure our progress remains on track.

In addition to these group efforts, we assigned specific tasks to individual team members for further developing our project methodology, outlining the resources needed, organizing our project management structure, and planning the recording of our presentation. For the project methodology section, we discussed the importance of grounding our approach in the scientific method and best practices, as required. Our methodology will include two major components: a literature review and a technical plan.

For the literature review, we agreed to survey a broad range of topics relevant to IoT device security, ensuring that we cover key research and development work in the field. We will identify important keywords such as "IoT security," "firmware updates," "default credentials," and "user stories" and review relevant research papers that represent the state of the art. Each annotated bibliography entry will use a structured abstract format, ensuring that our summaries are informative and useful for later reference. Each member will review 2-3 surveys or studies over given categories. 

The technical plan will outline a detailed methodology for our project, describing exactly what and how we plan to accomplish our objectives. This plan will include our research design, data collection techniques, testing and development methods, architectural considerations, and data analysis strategies. We emphasized that our technical plan must be rooted in scientific method, using well-tested methods wherever possible, and should integrate best practices derived from our literature review. We also discussed the importance of defining user stories and use cases to capture the behavior and requirements of end users, ensuring that our methodology not only remains robust but also relevant and achievable within the class duration.

Overall, the meeting was productive, with clear action items distributed among team members to ensure a strong start to our project. We are confident that our detailed discussion on the project methodology has set us on the right path to meet the rigorous requirements of our capstone, and we look forward to reviewing our progress in our follow-up meeting on Monday.
